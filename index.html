				            RETURNS
				            Our policy lasts 30 days. If 30 days have gone by since your purchase, unfortunately we cannot offer you a refund or exchange.
				            To be eligible for a return, your item must be unused and in the same condition that you received it. It must also be in the original packaging.
				            Several types of goods are exempt from being returned. Perishable goods such as food, flowers, newspapers or magazines cannot be returned. We also do not accept products that are intimate or sanitary goods, hazardous materials, or flammable liquids or gases.

				            Additional non-returnable items include:
				              Gift cards
				              Downloadable software products
				              Some health and personal care items

				            To complete your return, we require a receipt or proof of purchase.
				            Please do not send your purchase back to the manufacturer.

				            There are certain situations where only partial refunds are granted: (if applicable)
				              Book with obvious signs of use
				              CD, DVD, VHS tape, software, video game, cassette tape, or vinyl record that has been opened.
				              Any item not in its original condition, is damaged or missing parts for reasons not due to our error.
				              Any item that is returned more than 30 days after delivery

				            REFUNDS (if applicable)
				            Once your return is received and inspected, we will send you an email to notify you that we have received your returned item. We will also notify you of the approval or rejection of your refund.
				            If you are approved, then your refund will be processed, and a credit will automatically be applied to your credit card or original method of payment, within a certain amount of days. 

				            Late or missing refunds (if applicable)
				            If you haven't received a refund yet, please check your bank or credit card account again then contact the respective financial institution, as there is often some processing time before a refund is posted.  
				            If you've done all of this and you still have not received your refund yet, please contact us at email_default.

				            Sale items (if applicable)
				            Only regular priced items may be refunded, unfortunately sale items cannot be refunded.

				            EXCHANGES (if applicable)
				            We only replace items if they are defective or damaged.  If you need to exchange it for the same item, send us an email at email_default and send your item to: address_default city_default state_default zip_default.

				            Gifts
				            If the item was marked as a gift when purchased and shipped directly to you, you will receive a gift credit for the value of your return. Once the returned item is received, a gift certificate will be mailed to you.
				            If the item was not marked as a gift when purchased, or the gift giver had the order shipped to themselves to give to you later, we will send a refund to the gift giver and he will find out about your return.

				            SHIPPING
				            To return your product, you should mail your product to: address_default city_default state_default zip_default.

				            You will be responsible for paying for your own shipping costs for returning your item. Shipping costs are non-refundable. If you receive a refund, the cost of return shipping will be deducted from your refund.

				            Depending on where you live, the time frame to receive your exchanged product may vary.

				            If you are returning an item over $75, you should consider using a shipping service that offers tracking or purchasing shipping insurance. 
				            We offer no guarantees towards the receiving of your returned item.

				          SECTION 1 - TRANSACTIONAL INFORMATION
				          What do you do with my information?

				          When you purchase something from our store, as part of the buying and selling process, we collect the personal information you give us such as your name, address and email address.
				          When you browse our store, we also automatically receive your computer Internet protocol (IP) address in order to provide us with information that helps us learn about your browser and operating system.

				          Email marketing (if applicable): 
				          With your permission, we may send you emails about our store, new products and other updates.

				          SECTION 2 - CONSENT
				          How do you get my consent?

				          When you provide us with personal information to complete a transaction, verify your credit card, place an order, arrange for a delivery or return a purchase, we imply that you consent to our collecting it and using it for that specific reason only.
				          If we ask for your personal information for a secondary reason, such as marketing, we will either ask you directly for your expressed consent, or provide you with an opportunity to say no.

				          How do I withdraw my consent?

				          After you opt-in, if you change your mind, you may withdraw your consent for us to contact you, for the continued collection, use or disclosure of your information, at any time, by contacting us at email_default or mailing us at: store_name_default address_default city_default state_default country_default zip_default.

				          SECTION 3 - DISCLOSURE
				          Do you disclose my information?

				          We may disclose your personal information if we are required by law to do so or if you violate our Terms of Service.

				          SECTION 4 - 3dcart

				          Our store is hosted on 3dcart. They provide us with the online e-commerce platform that allows us to sell our products and services to you.
				          Your data is stored through 3dcart's data storage, databases and the general 3dcart application. As such, your data is stored on a secure server behind a firewall.

				          Payment:

				          If you choose a direct payment gateway to complete your purchase, 3dcart stores your credit card data. The store data is encrypted through the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS). Your purchase transaction data is stored only as long as is necessary to complete your purchase transaction. After that is complete, your purchase transaction information is deleted.
				          All direct payment gateways adhere to the standards set by PCI-DSS as managed by the PCI Security Standards Council, which is a joint effort of brands like Visa, MasterCard, American Express and Discover.
				          PCI-DSS requirements help ensure the secure handling of credit card information by our store and its service providers.
				          For more insight, you may also want to read 3dcart's Terms of Service here or Privacy Statement here.

				          SECTION 5 - THIRD-PARTY SERVICES

				          In general, the third-party providers we use will only collect, use, and disclose your information to the extent necessary to allow them to perform the services they provide to us.
				          However, certain third-party service providers, such as payment gateways and other payment transaction processors, have their own privacy policies in respect to the information we are required to provide to them for your purchase-related transactions.
				          For these providers, we recommend that you read their privacy policies so you can understand the manner in which your personal information will be handled by these providers.

				          In particular, remember that certain providers may be located in or have facilities that are located in a different jurisdiction than either you or us. So if you elect to proceed with a transaction that involves the services of a third-party service provider, then your information may become subject to the laws of the jurisdiction(s) in which that service provider or its facilities are located.

				          As an example, if you are located in Canada and your transaction is processed by a payment gateway located in the United States, then your personal information used in completing that transaction may be subject to disclosure under United States legislation, including the Patriot Act.

				          Once you leave our store website or are redirected to a third-party website or application, you are no longer governed by this Privacy Policy or our website's Terms of Service.

				          SECTION 6 - SECURITY

				          To protect your personal information, we take reasonable precautions and follow industry best practices to make sure it is not inappropriately lost, misused, accessed, disclosed, altered or destroyed.

				          If you provide us with your credit card information, the information is encrypted using secure socket layer technology (SSL) and stored with AES-256 encryption.  Although no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is 100% secure, we follow all PCI-DSS requirements and implement additional generally accepted industry standards.

				        We cannot guarantee when an order will arrive. Consider any shipping or transit time offered to you by store_name_default or other parties only as an estimate. We encourage you to order in a timely fashion to avoid delays caused by shipping or product availability.

				        SECTION 6 - MULTIPLE PRODUCT ORDERS
				        For a multiple product order, we will make every attempt to ship all products contained in the order at the same time. Products that are unavailable at the time of shipping will be shipped as they become available, unless you inform us otherwise. You will only be charged for products contained in a given shipment, plus any applicable shipping charges. You will only be charged for shipping at the rate quoted to you on your purchase receipt. The entirety of this shipping charge may be applied to the first product(s) shipped on a multiple shipment order.

				        SECTION 7 - TAXES
				        Our Store shall automatically charge and withhold the applicable sales tax for orders to be delivered to addresses within the state of state_default. For orders shipped to other states, you are solely responsible for all sales taxes or other taxes.
